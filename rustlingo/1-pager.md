# Proposal: Adopting Rust for Duolingo

## Introduction
Duolingo, renowned for its innovative approach to language learning, continuously seeks to improve its technological stack to enhance performance, security, and developer productivity. Rust, a systems programming language focused on safety and performance, offers several compelling benefits that align with Duolingo's goals.

## Key Benefits of Rust

### 1. **Memory Safety**
Rust’s ownership model ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector. This prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferencing, buffer overflows, and data races, leading to more reliable and secure applications.

### 2. **Performance**
Rust’s performance is on par with C and C++, enabling the development of high-speed applications. This can be particularly beneficial for performance-critical components of Duolingo's backend infrastructure and real-time features.

### 3. **Concurrency**
Rust makes it easier to write concurrent programs safely and efficiently. Its ownership and type systems eliminate data races at compile time, ensuring that concurrent code runs reliably. This is crucial for Duolingo's scalable, real-time language learning platform.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Development**
Rust supports cross-platform development, allowing Duolingo to maintain a consistent codebase across different operating systems. This can simplify the development process and reduce maintenance overhead.

### 5. **Interoperability**
Rust can interoperate with existing C and C++ codebases, facilitating a gradual transition. Duolingo can incrementally adopt Rust in performance-critical or newly developed components without overhauling the entire existing system.

### 6. **Growing Ecosystem**
The Rust ecosystem is rapidly growing, with an increasing number of libraries and tools that can support a wide range of applications. This expanding ecosystem provides the resources needed for efficient development and problem-solving.

### 7. **Community and Support**
Rust has a vibrant and supportive community. This can be invaluable for Duolingo's development team, offering ample learning resources, forums for troubleshooting, and contributions to open-source projects.

## Potential Use Cases

### 1. **Backend Services**
Rewriting performance-critical backend services in Rust can lead to significant improvements in speed and efficiency, enhancing the overall user experience.

### 2. **Real-Time Features**
Rust’s safety and concurrency features make it ideal for developing real-time features such as live interactions, instant feedback, and multiplayer activities.

### 3. **Mobile Applications**
Rust's capability to compile to WebAssembly (Wasm) can be leveraged to improve the performance of mobile applications, providing a smoother and faster user experience.

## Conclusion
Adopting Rust can provide Duolingo with substantial advantages in terms of safety, performance, and developer productivity. By leveraging Rust's unique features, Duolingo can enhance its technological foundation, ensuring a robust, scalable, and efficient platform for its millions of users.

## Next Steps
- **Pilot Project:** Initiate a small-scale pilot project to evaluate Rust's impact.
- **Training:** Provide Rust training sessions for the development team.
- **Integration Plan:** Develop a roadmap for gradual integration of Rust into existing systems.
